Dance Dance Revolution DIY Board

# Current status 
Created one arrow prototype as a proof on concept, now working on refining both the build of the individual arrows and removing the Arduino to replace it with an I-PAC.

# Goal 
Create a two-person dance machine for the arcade machine Bunts made.

# Ingredients for the prototype:
- Arduino UNO
- Processing
- Wires
- MDF
- Aluminium Bars
- Electrical tape
- Insulation foam
- Copper tape with conductive adhesive

# Progress made:
- Experimented with aluminium foil circuits
- Ditched it for sensors that mimic that of actual metal dance machines
- Prototyped a sensor to send signal
- Prototyped an arrow containing 4 sensors wired together, sending a signal to the Arduino serial and Processing
