Dance Dance Revolution DIY Board

# Current status 
Created a 2P DIY Dance Mat with custom sensors. Communicates via Arduino as a keystroke. Next step is crafting the metal stabiliser bar to pull off sweet dance moves.

# Goal 
Create a two-person dance machine for my lounge room.

# Ingredients for the prototype:
- Arduino Leonardo
- Processing
- Wires
- MDF
- Aluminium Bars
- Electrical tape
- Insulation foam tape
- Copper tape with conductive adhesive

# Progress history:
- Experimented with aluminium foil circuits
- Ditched it for sensors that mimic that of actual metal dance machines
- Prototyped a sensor to send signal
- Prototyped an arrow containing 4 sensors wired together, sending a signal to the Arduino serial and Processing
- Made 2 x dance mats, wired and communicating to StepMania
